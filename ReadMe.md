Our SHTF Android app!

This app keeps track of your emergency inventory, in regards to amount, expiration date and energy value.

Items can be added to your inventory manually or via the built in barcode scanner.
The app is connected to the Open Food Facts API.

You can calculate how long your inventory will last based on energy value.
